  Gatsby's Square payments starter
</h1>

Kick off your next Gatsby project with [Square](https://squareup.com/us/en) using this starter. 

This minimal starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React and also a sample serverless function to complete the payment process. 

As this starter matures it will probably offer more possibilities and options based on the Square payments options. Be on the lookout.

## Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the square starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using square
    gatsby new [my-awesome-site] https://github.com/jonniebigodes/gatsby-starter-square
    ```

2. **Setup a Square account**

    Set up a developer account in the [Square developer portal](https://squareup.com/signup?v=developers) to get started. 

    Go through the steps to create a app (don't use the word **square** as it's a reserved word) and don't forget to save the token, application id and localization id provided. As they are required for your project. 

3.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and take a look at the `.env.sample` file, this file works as a baseline to store your Square application keys.

    Create your own `.env` file with the information provided in the Square developer portal.
    
    Run the following command to start your development mode:

    ```shell
    yarn start
    ```

4.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    Open the `my-awesome-site` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── config
    ├── functions
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .env.sample
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── netlify.toml
    ├── yarn.lock
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2. **`/config`**: Inside this directory is a custom webpack config file for the serverless function to allow the the square payments sdk to run in a serverless environmnent. You can also add you own files here.

3.  **`/functions`**: Inside this directory you'll find a sample serverless function that will use the square payments sdk to finalize your payment process. 

4.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

5.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

6.  **`.env.sample`**: This is a sample file to demonstrate the usage of the environment variables required for the starter to run properly.

7.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.


8.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).


9.  **`LICENSE`**: This starter is licensed under the MIT license.

10.  **`netlify.toml`**: The configuration file required for building the starter in [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). 

10. **`yarn.lock`** (See `package.json` below, first). Both these files are automatically generated based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

## Deploy

Before you deploy don't forget to change your app from sandbox mode to production mode in the [Square developer portal](https://developer.squareup.com/apps) and adjust the variables and endpoints acordingly.
